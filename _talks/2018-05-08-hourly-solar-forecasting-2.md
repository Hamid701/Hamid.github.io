The global situation of climate change is becoming increasingly serious due to the exhaustion of fossil fuels. In this study, we focus on solar energy, which has gained significant attention in recent decades as a sustainable alternative. Integrating solar energy into electricity networks requires reliable forecasting of solar resources to quantify available energy and optimize the transition between intermittent and conventional energy sources.

Building on our previous research, which identified Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) as a superior approach for daily global solar irradiance forecasting in Rabat, Morocco, this study investigates the **hourly forecasting case**. We compared two approaches:  
1. **Linear modeling** using classical SARIMA models.  
2. **Non-linear modeling** using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), specifically Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), in both univariate and multivariate cases.  

ANNs have been widely demonstrated to excel in predicting weather-related time series data. In this study, we examined the performance of MLP, a commonly used ANN structure in renewable energy forecasting. The results showed that ANN models outperformed linear approaches, providing more accurate predictions for 24-hour-ahead global solar irradiance.

This work underscores the potential of ANNs in improving short-term solar energy forecasting, offering valuable insights for optimizing energy management in smart grids and advancing renewable energy integration.
