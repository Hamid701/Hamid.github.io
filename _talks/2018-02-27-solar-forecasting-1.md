As the world shifts toward renewable energy to combat global warming, solar energy has emerged as a critical resource. However, integrating solar energy into electricity networks requires accurate forecasting to quantify available energy and optimize the transition between intermittent and conventional energy sources. In this study, we explore forecasting techniques for daily global solar irradiance in the region of Rabat, Morocco.

We compared two approaches:  
1. **Linear modeling** using classical ARIMA-GARCH and exponential smoothing models.  
2. **Non-linear modeling** using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), specifically Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), a widely used structure in renewable energy and time series forecasting.

Our research investigated both univariate and multivariate cases, using statistical feature parameters to identify the optimal MLP structure. The results demonstrated that MLP models with exogenous variables outperformed other approaches, offering superior accuracy in predicting solar irradiance.

This work highlights the potential of ANNs in renewable energy forecasting and provides actionable insights for improving solar energy integration into smart grids.
