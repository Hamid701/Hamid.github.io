Welcome to my data science portfolio. I am a data scientist with a passion for extracting insightful trends from big data and designing models that tackle genuine challenges.

My adventure started in a classroom, as explaining difficult mathematical principles to students made me realize that with each mathematical concept is a tale that can be shared.
This made me turn towards data science - a field in which maths is used to convert raw data into insightful narratives.


## My Data Science Philosophy

I believe that good data science is fundamentally a mix between technical proficiency and functional application. I bring mathematical solidity combined with innovative application
in machine learning in a bid to create solutions that are not merely sound in theory but that deliver quantifiable impacts.

What drives my work is understanding ways in which I can uncover hidden relationships in data, whether that is with attention models that are able to capture weak temporal
dependencies in time series, or with models that are not merely predicting, but are providing us with understanding.

## Areas of Expertise

My focus in data science spans several interconnected domains:

- **Time Series Analysis & Forecasting**: Developing advanced predictive models that capture complex temporal patterns
- **Deep Learning Architecture Design**: Adapting and optimizing neural network architectures for specialized applications
- **Statistical Modeling**: Blending classical statistical methods with modern machine learning approaches
- **Data Visualization & Storytelling**: Transforming analysis into compelling, actionable narratives

I am particularly interested in understanding how a methodology from a particular field can be transferred into another - i.e. applying models from NLP developed with a transformer
architecture in time series forecasting challenges.

## Beyond the Algorithms

Most engaging about data science is not necessarily making effective models, but models that have impact. I'm interested in challenges in which more accurate predictions have direct application in the real world.

Throughout this website, you can see examples of how I've implemented these principles in a variety of projects and research projects.
I welcome you to browse around and get in touch with me if you have interest in discussing data science challenges, methods, or collaborating.
